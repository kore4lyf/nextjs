## Introduction

Next.js is a powerful React framework that provides a comprehensive set of tools and features for building modern web applications. It enables developers to create fast, user-friendly websites with ease, leveraging both server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improve SEO and initial load times by rendering pages on the server.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generate static HTML files at build time, ensuring lightning-fast load times and reduced server costs.
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints directly within your Next.js application.
- **File-based Routing**: Simple and intuitive page routing using the file system.
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Optimize performance by splitting code into smaller bundles that are loaded as needed.
- **CSS and Sass Support**: Easily include and manage styles in your application.
- **TypeScript Support**: Built-in TypeScript support for type-safe development.

## Installation

To create a new Next.js project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nextjs.git
   cd nextjs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Getting Started

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the pages by modifying the files in the `pages` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project structure looks like this:

```
nextjs/
├── public/          # Static files
├── pages/           # Page components and routes
│   ├── api/         # API routes
│   ├── index.js     # Home page
│   └── _app.js      # Custom App component
├── styles/          # CSS/Sass files
├── components/      # Reusable components
├── utils/           # Utility functions
├── .gitignore       # Git ignore file
├── package.json     # Project configuration and dependencies
└── README.md        # Project documentation
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm start`: Starts the production server.
- `npm run lint`: Runs the linter to check for code quality issues.
